## Purpose
This is a password generator that generates a random password depending on the user's input. It is to provide the user with a strong and secure password. It allows the user the select the following: character length (required), uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.

## Progress/Current Function 
I have not finished the actual functionality of it yet. The CSS and HTML are finished, however. It is responsive and the graphics are clean, and it adapts well to multiple screen sizes. The .js file currently has some non-working (work in progress) functions and many variables (const). Once I better understand the syntax and logic, I'll come back and update this so it actually works.
