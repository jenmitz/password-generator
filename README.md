<img width="1621" alt="password-gen-ss" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49658803/95154904-c25ed780-0747-11eb-9f0a-d7775b70afca.png">

## Purpose
This is a password generator that generates a random password depending on the users input. It allows the user the select their desired character length (required) from 8 - 58 and choose their character type(s) (at least one required) from uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides the user with a strong and secure password as a result.

## Progress/Current Function 
I have not finished the full functionality of this yet, but it is coming along very well. Beyond the HTML and CSS being complete, the JavaScript correctly registers user input and generates random characters based on that input. It returns no errors, console logs all relevant information, and is relatively dry. The only things left to finish are getting requested amount of randomized values from the final (dynamically-created) array and populating the HTML with the result of said randomization.

Funcitonality is incomplete, but coming along well. The HTML/CSS are finished. The JavaScript correctly registers user input and generates random characters based on that input. It has functioning error handling, console logs all relevant information, populates the password field, and is relatively dry. The things left to finish are getting the correct (requested) amount of randomized characters from the final array and getting the function to stop if errors occur.

## Usage
1. Enter a number from 5-58, which represents the character length of final password.
2. Select 1-4 boxes that represent character types.
3. Click "Generate" when selections have been made.
4. Refresh button if you want to create a new password.
