## Purpose
This is a password generator that generates a random password depending on the user's input. It allows the user the select their desired character length (required) from 8 - 58 and choose their character type(s) (at least one required) from uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides the user with a strong and secure password as a result.

## Functionality 
- Correctly registers user input
- Generates the correct amount/type of random characters
- Returns no errors
- DRY

## Progress
- The copy button is incomplete and does not work

## Usage
1. Enter a number from 8-58, which dictates the character length of the generated password
2. Select 1-4 boxes that represent different character types
3. Click "Generate" when selections have been made to generate a password
4. Click "Refresh" to refresh the page to get an empty form again
